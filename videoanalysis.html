							<h2>Below is the video I chose to edit. As an alpine ski coach it wsa an interesting opportunity to see some old-school(ish) technique. I proved some very basic and high-level feedback for the athlete. It was definitely watered down from what I would say to my own athletes, but still valid. Using dartfish myself was interesting, as I had coaches who used this software to analyze my video when I was an athlete. </h2>
